## What and how to Contribute

To contribute to the list, there are a few things that are worth outlining before attempting an edit.

- Primarily, this is a learning resource, secondly it's a place to find links and places to buy parts so people can get started in building their robots.
- **This is not a builders directory.** This isn't a place to list who builds robots, this is primarily to help people get started. This is not a conduit to potentially harass builders.
- **This is not a team directory.** Like the above, this is also not a place to list teams. There are facebook pages and websites for that.
- **This is a place to list suppliers and stores.** Conversely, this is place to list parts suppliers, even if it's headed by a robot combat team.
- If you're unsure where to place a link for learning, here's a few tips:
  - If it's a basic tutorial, is not too detailed and is suitable for beginners, consider placing it under 'Robot Combat Basics'.
  - If it deals with a full build of a particular weight category, place the link under 'Building Fighting Robots' under the appropriate weight category.
  - If it's a tip or a tutorial i.e. how to program an ESC or making a component, this belongs in the 'Hacks and Tips' section.
- If you're not sure about something, please get in touch with the list creator.

If you're going to contribute, the simple way of doing this is (obviously) having a Github account. You can then be able to fork this list and make the necessary changes to the `readme.md` document.

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult.
If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to
edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit
the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that,
[here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md)
